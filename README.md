# Cleaner-Hits

## Purpose
In Minecraft 1.8.+, Mojang added a slight delay after attacking and missing an entity. This slight delay was subtle yet made the pvp experience feel worse compared to the previous major version, 1.7.10.  
This mod overwrites the class and rewrites it to the same class used in 1.7.10
