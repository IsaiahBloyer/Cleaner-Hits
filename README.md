# Cleaner-Hits

## Purpose
In Minecraft 1.8.*, Mojang added a slight delay after attacking and missing an entity. This slight delay was subtle yet made the pvp experience feel worse compared to the previous major version, 1.7.10  
This mod overwrites the class and rewrites it to the same class used in 1.7.10  

## Disclaimer
This mod is not necessary anymore, as most 1.8.9 clients already directly incorproate this change, in addition to not being compatible with versions 1.9+  
This mod is not originally my idea either. During 2020 when this was made, some clients and circles were already utilizing this yet was not disclosed to the greater community
